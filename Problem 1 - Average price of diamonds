## The data set includes the price of diamonds according to their colours. 

# Problem :- IS there enough evidence to claim that average price of diamond for colour B is more than 1500?
# Let's get started.

# Step1 :- Import the data set in R. I have imported the data in a vector "mydata" I have attached the data set as Damond Colours in this repository

mydata <- read.csv(file.choose())

# Let us explore the data

str(mydata)

#Output :- 
#'data.frame':	90 obs. of  2 variables:
# $ Diamond.Color: Factor w/ 7 levels " X","A","B","C",..: 2 3 5 5 2 3 4 5 7 6 ... # levels shows number of colours i.e 7
# $ Price        : int  1302 1510 1510 1260 1641 1555 1427 1427 1126 1126 ...      
 
 # you can explore and understand the data set more by using following code


summary(mydata)
nrow(mydata)        # shows number of rows
ncol(mydata)        # shows number of columns
mean(mydata$Price)  # mean of price
sd(mydata$Price)    # standard deviation of price

#Confidence Interval = 95%
#Alpha = 0.05

# Null Hypothesis H0 : µ = 1500
# Alternate Hypothesis H1 : µ > 1500

t.test(mydata$Price,mu=1500,alternative="greater")  # Perform a t-test


#Output :- 
#data:  mydata$Price
#t = 10.157, df = 89, p-value < 2.2e-16
#alternative hypothesis: true mean is greater than 1500
#95 percent confidence interval:
#3018.173      Inf
#sample estimates:
#mean of x 
#3315.244 

# P-value is less than 2.2e-16 i.e. 0.00000000000000022, which is very less than alpha (0.05).
# So null hypothesis is rejected. Thus price of diamond with colour B is more than 1500.
